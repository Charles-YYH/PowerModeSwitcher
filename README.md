## Power Mode

Power mode allows you to optimize your Windows 11 device based on power use and performance.

You can choose between the Best power efficiency, Balanced (default), or Best performance power mode.

- Best power efficiency: Saves power by reducing PC performance and screen brightness. If you're using a laptop, this mode can help you get the most from a single battery charge.
- Balanced: Offers full performance when you need it and saves power when you don't. This is the best mode for most people.
- Best performance: Maximizes screen brightness and might increase PC performance. This mode uses a lot more energy, so your laptop battery won't last as long between charges.
